# Project Overview

## 1. Project Goal

**[AI Agent: Please replace this section with a clear and concise description of the project's primary objective. What business problem are we trying to solve or what research question are we trying to answer?]**

_Example: "The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on their usage patterns and demographic data. This will help the marketing team to proactively target at-risk customers with retention campaigns."_

## 2. Core Architecture

This project follows a standard data science workflow. The architecture is designed to be modular and reproducible.

- **Data Ingestion:** How and from where will the data be sourced? (e.g., S3 buckets, databases, APIs).
- **Data Processing/ETL:** What are the key steps for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data? (e.g., using scripts in `src/`, notebooks in `notebooks/`).
- **Modeling:** What kind of models will be developed? (e.g., scikit-learn classifiers, deep learning models in PyTorch/TensorFlow). Model training scripts and experiments will be managed here.
- **Evaluation:** How will model performance be measured and tracked? (e.g., using specific metrics, visualization in `notebooks/plots`).
- **Deployment (Optional):** How will the final model be served or integrated into other systems?

**[AI Agent: Fill in the specifics for each of the above points based on the project requirements.]**

## 3. Key Components of this Template

This repository provides a standardized structure to accelerate data science projects.

- `src/`: The main Python source code for the project.
  - `file_utils.py`: Helpers for file and directory manipulation.
  - `log_utils.py`: Robust logging for tracking experiments and code execution.
  - `np_utils.py`: Utility functions for NumPy.
  - `params/`: A centralized module for managing parameters like file paths and hyperparameters.
- `notebooks/`: For exploratory data analysis (EDA), experiments, and visualizations.
- `environment.yml`: Defines the `conda` environment to ensure a reproducible dependency setup.
- `pyproject.toml`: Enables the `src` directory to be installed as a local Python package.

## 4. Expected Workflow

A typical workflow for a project using this template would be:

1.  **Setup:** Initialize the project using `build_template.py`.
2.  **Data Exploration:** Use notebooks in `notebooks/` to perform EDA on the raw data.
3.  **Develop Processing Logic:** Write reusable data processing functions in the `src/` directory.
4.  **Feature Engineering:** Create new features and save them, using notebooks and `src/` code.
5.  **Model Training:** Write and run model training scripts. Use `log_utils` to log results.
6.  **Evaluation & Iteration:** Analyze model performance and iterate on features and models.

**[AI Agent: Use this workflow as a guide. You can update the `task_list.md` with specific tasks corresponding to these stages.]**
